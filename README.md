# 8-Bit Digital Logic Debuggers

## description
Different programs that simulate different digital logic components that I designed to help debug my 8-bit breadboard computer.

## programs list and function

1. Binary to Decimal Converter - Input a binary number by checking the checkboxes for corresponding 1s then the result will display as you go.
2. 8-Bit Adder with Carry In and Out Simulator - Input 2 8-Bit binary numbers into input A and B and a Carry in flag then the program will provide you the corresponding decimal and binary values as well as Carry out.

## installation

1. Install PyQt5 library
2. Clone the repo then run main.py for the programs you want to use

## notes

I made this in order to motivate myself to learn more digital design and to help myself debug the 8-bit breadboard computer I plan on building. The more I learn the more programs I plan on adding as I progress.
