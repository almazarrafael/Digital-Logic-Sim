# Digital Logic Simulators/Debuggers

## description
A variety of programs that simulate different digital logic components that I designed for educational purposes and to help me debug my 8-bit breadboard computer.

## programs list and function

1. __8-Bit Binary to Decimal Converter__ - Input a binary number by checking the checkboxes for corresponding 1s then the result will display as you go.
2. __Logic Gates Simulator__ - Input two binary values into each logic gate to see the desired result of each gate.
3. __Mux and Demux Simulator__ - Input select bits to choose which input signals you want to select. Mux selects from four inputs while demux selects from four outputs.
4. __8-Bit Adder Simulator__ - Input 2 8-Bit binary numbers into input A and B and a Carry in flag then the program will provide you the corresponding decimal and binary values as well as Carry out.

## installation

1. Install PyQt5 library
2. Clone the repo then run main.py for the programs you want to use

## notes

I made this in order to motivate myself to learn more digital design and to help myself debug the 8-bit breadboard computer I plan on building. The more I learn the more programs I plan on adding as I progress. These programs are in no way meant to fully simulate each logic gate in each component but instead to simulate the overall input/output for debugging and educational purposes.
